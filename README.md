<h1>Really Basic TR-31 Block Generation Library</h1>

This is a basic command line implementation of TR-31 in python.
The idea behind this is to allow the generation of valid blocks for testing of different hardware etc.

Also includes a simple CMAC library

No warranty, no support offered. 
Don't run in a production environment as i can't be bothered writing all the test cases and adding all the support code.
